Demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61dwd36fJaE

This project was developed using Godot. The most recent version of the code has been tested and verified to function properly with Godot Mono 4.2.1.

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's Degree Final Project. It was inspired by https://probabletrain.itch.io/city-generator and is based on Chen, Guoning & Esch, Gregory & Wonka, Peter & MÃ¼ller, Pascal & Zhang, Eugene. (2008). Interactive Procedural Street Modeling. ACM Trans. Graph.. 27. 10.1145/1399504.1360702.
